# Numerical Solution of Differential Equations: Introduction to the Finite-Difference Method

In this module I introduce the finite-difference method to solve ordinary differential equations.

## Lecture 2: Introduction to the Finite-Difference Method

### [Lesson 1](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/github.com/daniel-koehn/Differential-equations-earth-system/tree/master/02_finite_difference_intro/1_fd_intro.ipynb): Finite Difference Approximations

We discuss different finite difference approximations of first and second derivatives of the Gaussian function and their accuracy.

### [Lesson 2](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/github.com/daniel-koehn/Differential-equations-earth-system/tree/master/02_finite_difference_intro/2_fd_optimum_gridpoint_dist.ipynb): What is an "optimum" grid point distance?

How do we choose the "optimum" spatial or temporal grid point distance for the given FD-scheme in order to find the sweet spot 
between numerical accuracy of the solution and computation time. To achieve this goal, I introduce the concept of gridpoints 
per wavelength and demonstrate the accuracy for an under- and oversampled computation of the first derivative of the sine function.

### [Lesson 3](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/github.com/daniel-koehn/Differential-equations-earth-system/tree/master/02_finite_difference_intro/3_fd_ODE_example_sailing_wo_wind.ipynb): Exercise: How to sail without wind

In this exercise, we learn how to sail without wind by solving the simplest uncoupled ordinary differential equation I can imagine.
