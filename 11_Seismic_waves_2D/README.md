# Differential Equations in Earth Sciences: 2D seismic wave propagation

In this module, we develop a basic 2D acoustic finite difference solver in order to model the propagation of acoustic waves, 
commonly used to approximate the elastic seismic wave propagation in the solid earth.

## Lecture 11: 2D seismic wave propagation

### [Lesson 1](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/github.com/daniel-koehn/Differential-equations-earth-system/tree/master/11_Seismic_waves_2D/1_2D_acoustic_FD_mod.ipynb): 2D acoustic finite-difference modelling

One approximation of the elastic equations of motion is the 2D acoustic wave equation. In this notebook we will discuss the 
finite difference approximation and model wave propagation for problems of different complexity. From a simple homogeneous 
half-space to complex subsurface models with significant spatial variations of the acoustic (P-wave) velocity. 

### [Lesson 2](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/github.com/daniel-koehn/Differential-equations-earth-system/tree/master/11_Seismic_waves_2D/2_2D_acoustic_marmousi_model.ipynb): 2D acoustic FD modelling of the Marmousi-2 model

In this notebook we will learn how to compute a seismic OBC survey for a common benchmark problem - the Marmousi-2 problem, 
using the 2D acoustic finite difference modelling code developed in the last lesson.
