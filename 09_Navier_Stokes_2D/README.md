# Differential Equations in Earth Sciences: 2D Navier-Stokes equations

In this module, we develop a basic 2D Navier-Stokes solver and model laminar cavity and channel flow fields.

## Lecture 9: 2D Navier-Stokes equations

### [Lesson 1](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/github.com/daniel-koehn/Differential-equations-earth-system/tree/master/09_Navier_Stokes_2D/01_2D_Navier-Stokes_Cavity_Flow.ipynb): 2D Navier–Stokes - Cavity Flow
 
In this lecture, we discuss the basics of solving the 2D Navier-Stokes equations for numerical fluid flow modelling. After covering the basic governing 
equations and finite-difference based solvers, a simple cavity flow problem is solved.

### [Lesson 2](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/github.com/daniel-koehn/Differential-equations-earth-system/tree/master/09_Navier_Stokes_2D/02_2D_Navier-Stokes_Channel_Flow.ipynb): 2D Navier–Stokes - Channel Flow

In this notebook, we will use our very basic 2D Navier-Stokes solver to model the flow field in a channel, also known as Poiseuille flow.

### [Lesson 3](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/github.com/daniel-koehn/Differential-equations-earth-system/tree/master/09_Navier_Stokes_2D/03_2D_Navier-Stokes_Flow_past_obstacles.ipynb): 2D Navier–Stokes - Fluid flow past obstacles

So far, we described fluid flow by a continuum mechanics approach using the Navier-Stokes equations. An alternative is based on statistical 
physics of particles phase space density distributions, leading to the Boltzmann equation. This allows a microscopic interpretation of 
macroscopic fluid flow properties, like density, flow velocities and viscosity. We solve the Boltzmann equation using the Lattice-Boltzmann 
method to model turbulent flow past a cylindrical obstacle.
