# Differential Equations in the Earth System
Course material for the lecture "Differential Equations in the Earth System" (WS 2019/2020)
at the Institute of Geosciences (Department of Geophysics), Christian-Albrechts-University Kiel

[Homepage "Differential Equations in the Earth System" lecture](https://danielkoehnsite.wordpress.com/blog/Differential-Equations-in-the-Earth System/)

This lecture will be based on the "Practical Numerical Methods with Python" course by Lorena A. Barba, Ian Hawke, Bernard Knaepen:

[https://github.com/numerical-mooc/numerical-mooc](Practical Numerical Methods with Python)

and the "CFD Python: the 12 steps to Navier-Stokes equations" course by Lorena A. Barba, Gilbert F. Forsyth:
